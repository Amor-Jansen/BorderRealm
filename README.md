# Border Realm

![Image of mockup]()

For this website I really wanted to challenge myself and learn how to code a 2D game using Vanilla JavaScript, no libraries and no frameworks. I bought a few extra courses through Udemy https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=javascript+game and watched a tonne of game development videos from https://www.franksworld.com/tag/franks-laboratory/. I followed many instructions from W3Schools as well, an also the Love-Maths project.

I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it.
